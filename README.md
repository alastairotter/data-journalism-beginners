# Data, mapping and journalism notes

This is a (very) loose collection of thoughts, ideas, examples, and tips on doing data journalism, mapping and coding. 

A lot of the material here comes from my own need to document things I have done (so I can repeat them), or just keep notes on ideas and thoughts around data journalism, mapping and code.
